## About the world:
Floral Shoppe 96 is a VRChat world dedicated as a tribute to the Vaporwave music genre. It contains avatars, jetskis, collectibles, achievements, and many more interactive elements.

It consists of these main areas to explore:
* Helios Plaza - The spawn point area starring Helios himself.
* Mt. Fiji - An inactive volcano that is the source of Fiji Vaporwave Water. A ramp leads up to its summit and a ramen spa.
* XP Island - An island designed to look like the Windows XP desktop.
* SEGA Loop - A Sonic-style loop with an art gallery and cherry blossom memorial. Visitors must traverse a series of moving platforms to reach the top.
* Future Funk City - A Sailor Moon-esque cityscape dedicated to the Future Funk music genre, closely related to vaporwave.

Please enjoy your chillout session.
